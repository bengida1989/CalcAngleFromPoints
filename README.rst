A Pointwise Glyph script which enables the user to determine the angle between 3 user selected points.These 
points can be grid points on a connector or a node from either an unstructured or structured domain.

The user must invoke the script to begin the point selection process. Once invoked, the script will 
prompt the user to select the "First Point". 

Next the user will be prompted to select the "Center Point" which serves as the vertex point for the
angle calculation.

Finally, the user is prompted to select the "Last Point" to conclude the point selection process.

At any point in the process the user can exit the script by selecting the "Cancel" button. Also, at
any point in the process the user can toggle on or off the connector grid points to make the selection 
process easier.
